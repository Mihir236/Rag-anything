The logo is circular in shape, with a light gray background and a darker gray border.\n\n**Logo Elements**\n\nAt the center of the logo is a stylized \"IIITV\" monogram, comprising four interconnected rectangles arranged in a square formation. The top-left rectangle is slightly taller than the others, while the bottom-right rectangle is wider. The monogram is rendered in a dark gray color, providing a clear visual contrast against the lighter background.\n\n**Surrounding Text**\n\nThe circular border surrounding the logo contains text in two languages: English and Hindi. The English text reads \"INDIAN INSTITUTE OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY VADODARA,\" while the Hindi text is written in Devanagari script. The text is arranged in a clockwise direction, starting from the top of the circle and moving downwards.\n\n**Additional Elements**\n\nTwo small stars are positioned on either side of the logo, one at the top and one at the bottom. These stars are depicted in dark gray and add a touch of elegance to the overall design.\n\n**Color Scheme**\n\nThe logo features a predominantly light gray background, which provides a clean and neutral backdrop for the darker gray text and visual elements. The use of dark gray for the monogram and stars creates a sense of sophistication and professionalism.\n\n**Technical Details**\n\nThe logo appears to be a vector graphic, as evidenced by its crisp lines and lack of pixelation. The file format is likely a scalable vector graphics (SVG) file, allowing for easy resizing and manipulation without compromising image quality.\n\n**Summary**\n\nIn summary, the Indian Institute of Information Technology Vadodara logo is a well-designed and visually appealing representation of the institution's brand identity. The use of a stylized monogram, surrounding text in two languages, and additional design elements creates a cohesive and professional image that effectively communicates the institute's values and mission.",

The flowchart is divided into three main steps: Retrieval, Augmentation, and Generation.\n\n**Retrieval Step**\n\n*   **PDF Input**: The process begins with a PDF input, where the user queries a PDF (e.g., \"Explain backpropagation in SVM.pdf\").\n*   **Text Extraction**: The system extracts text from the PDF using PyPDF2.\n*   **Chunk Splitting**: The extracted text is then split into manageable overlapping chunks using RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter.\n*   **Embedding Encoding**: Each chunk is encoded into numerical embeddings using NVIDIA nv-embedqa-e5-v5 embeddings.\n*   **Vector Database Search**: The encoded embeddings are stored and searched in a FAISS vector database to find top relevant content.\n\n**Augmentation Step**\n\n*   **Top-k Retrieval**: The top-k retrieved chunks (typically 3) act as factual context.\n*   **Context Summarization**: The summarize_context() function trims or summarizes this context to fit token limits using LLaMA-3.1-8B.\n\n**Generation Step**\n\n*   **Model Prompting**: The model (Mixtral-8x22B) is prompted with both the user query and retrieved context.\n*   **Informed Answer Generation**: The model produces an informed, concise answer consistent with the underlying document.\n\nThe flowchart provides a clear visual representation of the RAG process, highlighting the key steps involved in retrieving, augmenting, and generating informed answers.",
